# hello-world
a small step to GitHub is a great step in my self-development :D

Hi, I'm @steshwest!
I'm here to walk my path from a newbie in coding to a good developer :D
I love cats, coding and coffee - and sometimes all three of these happen at the same time. Very nice time. ^-^

I began coding with Pascal - at school - and proceeded with Fortran-90 while being a freshman at college. 
Now I am self-teaching C++ and Python because my former college teacher said he won't ever begin giving classes NOT about old good .f90 :/
Btw, my cats love coffe and coding, too. ^-^
